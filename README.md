  ## ‚ú® React Quiz App ‚ö°Ô∏è

   Welcome!

This React Quiz App was built using React JS, to emplement coding teachings from Nucamp Coding Boot Camp. This is a scratch built app using an API to quiz the user on his coding knowledge. This is intended to expose any knowledge gaps so the user can plug them. 

## Plan of attack
Home screen: <br/>
- Welcomes the user and downloads the questions a button to start.<br/> 
- When clicked takes you to the first question. <br/>
<br/>
Question screen:<br/>
- Use a single screen for all questions (1 ? at a time).<br/>
- When all the questions are answered take them to the results screen.<br/>
- Shows how many questions they have left.<br/>
<br/>
Results:<br/>
- Show the questions if they are right or wrong.<br/>
- Show how many they got right.<br/>
