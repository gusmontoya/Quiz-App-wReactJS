  ## ‚ú® React Quiz App ‚ö°Ô∏è

   Welcome!

This React Quiz App was built using React JS, to emplement coding teachings from Nucamp Coding Boot Camp. This is a scratch built app using an API to quiz the user on his coding knowledge. This is intended to expose any knowledge gaps so the user can plug them. 

## Plan of attack
Home screen:
Welcomes the user and downloads the questions
a button to start
When clicked takes you to the first question
Question screen:
Use a single screen for all questions (1 ? at a time)
When all the questions are answered take them to the results screen
Shows how many questions they have left.
Results:
Show the questions if they are right or wrong
Show how many they got right
If you think there is no way you could make this app then I suggest you start ASAP. Focus on
each screen and complete each screen before moving to the next. üòä
